todo:
- I made a bunch of terrible terrible variable names in camera.cpp (maybe other places)
- camera swivel doesn't work horizontal, seems to work okay vertical (but might not)
- camera move in viewing axis
- camera move perpendicular to viewing axis
- verify camera looking at object coords
- rotate wrt object shouldn't rotate object axes I think... maybe it should?
